This is Automake, a Makefile generator.  It was inspired by the 4.4BSD
make and include files, but aims to be portable and to conform to the
GNU Coding Standards for Makefile variables and targets.

Automake is a Perl script.  The input files are called Makefile.am.
The output files are called Makefile.in; they are intended for use
with Autoconf.  Automake requires certain things to be done in your
configure.ac.

Variable assignment lines in Makefile.am pull in defaults from various
little *.am files.

To use Automake, replace your Makefile.in files with Makefile.am
files.  Read the documentation to see what to do.

This package also includes the "aclocal" program.  aclocal is a
program to generate an `aclocal.m4' based on the contents of
`configure.ac'.  It is useful as an extensible, maintainable mechanism
for augmenting autoconf.  It is intended that other package authors
will write m4 macros which can be automatically used by aclocal.

Automake has a test suite.  Use

	make check

to run it.  For more information, see the file tests/README.

Automake has a page on the web.  See:

	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

Automake also has three mailing lists:

  * automake@gnu.org
    For general discussions of Automake and its interactions with other
    configuration/portability tools like Autoconf or Libtool.

  * bug-automake@gnu.org
    Where to send bug reports and feature requests.

  * automake-patches@gnu.org
    Where to send patches, and discuss the automake development process
    and the  design of new features.

To obtain more information about these list, or to subscribe to them,
refer to <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/#mailinglists>

New releases are announced to autotools-announce@gnu.org.  If you want to
be informed, subscribe to that list by following the instructions at
