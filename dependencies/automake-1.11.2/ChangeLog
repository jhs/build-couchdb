	dist-xz, dist-bzip2: don't hard-code -9, honor envvar settings
	Before the present change, automake-generated `dist-xz' rule used
	a hard-coded `xz -9'.  That was a problem because on this front,
	xz differs from gzip and bzip2.  While the latter two don't incur
	any run-time decompression penalty for using a higher compression
	level, specifying -9 with xz imposes a potentially fatal virtual
	memory requirement on any client that wants to decompress your
	tar.xz file.
	People have complained that a tarball compressed with -9 cannot
	be uncompressed in a low-memory environment (wrt-based embedded).
	Hence, instead of defaulting to -9, which is useful only for very
	large tarballs, it defaults to -e (equivalent to -6e).  This
	limits the default memory requirements imposed on decompressors,
	yet still gives very good compression ratios.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz): Do not hard-code xz's -9: that made
	it impossible to override.  Actually don't default to -9, either,
	since that induced inordinately large virtual memory usage when
	merely decompressing.  Instead, use its XZ_OPT envvar, defaulting
	to -e if not defined.  Suggested by Lasse Collin.
	(dist, dist-all) [?XZ?]: Likewise
	(dist-bzip2): Similarly, do not hard-code -9, but do continue to
	use -9 by default.  Honor the BZIP2 envvar.
	(dist, dist-all) [?BZIP2?]: Likewise
	* NEWS: Update.

	tests: fix spurious failures due to missing 'yywrap()' function

	The AC_PROG_LEX Autoconf macro does not diagnose a failure to find
	the "lex library" expected to provide a `yywrap' function (function
	which is required to link most lex-generated programs).  On the
	contrary, when all the link attempts (i.e., with `-ll' and `-lfl')
	fail, configure declares that no lex library is needed, and simply
	proceeds with the configuration process -- only for the build to
	possibly fail later, at make time.

	This behaviour is intended; the Autoconf manual reads:
	 ``You are encouraged to use Flex in your sources, since it is
	   both more pleasant to use than plain Lex and the C source it
	   produces is portable.  In order to ensure portability, however,
	   you must either provide a function `yywrap' or, if you don't use
	   it (e.g., your scanner has no `#include'-like feature), simply
	   include a `%noyywrap' statement in the scanner's source.''

	This AC_PROG_LEX behaviour is causing some spurious failures of
	the Automake testsuite in environments which lack a proper library
	providing `yywrap' (this happens for example on Fedora-based
	systems).   The proper workaround is to simply provide a fall-back
	implementation of `yywrap' in our lexers.

	See also partially-overlapping commit `v1.11-871-geb147a1' (from
	the 'testsuite-work' branch), which was motivated by similar
	spurious failures experienced when cross-compiling.

	info: allow user to inhibit creation/update of '${infodir}/dir'
	With this change, we allow the user to request the install-info

	This is especially useful to distro packagers, and is a definite
	improvement over our previous hack of looking whether the
	`install-info' program was the Debian or GNU version -- hack
	which had been silently broken with recent versions of debian
	install-info BTW (probably since dpkg 1.15.4, 2009-09-06).

	dejagnu: ensure 'srcdir' is defined as a relative directory
	This change fixes automake bug#7833.
	* lib/am/dejagnu.am (check-DEJAGNU): Prefer using plain $(srcdir)

	* tests/check12.test: Require runtest.

2010-12-10  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Extend and improve tests on DejaGnu support.
	* tests/dejagnu.test: Do not create useless dummy test script.
	Add trailing `:' command.  In heading comments, add reference
	to ...
	* tests/check12.test: ... this new "semantic" test, covering
	concurrent use of dejagnu tests, simple tests and `check-local'
	target.
	* tests/dejagnu2.test: Make test more reliable, by avoid weak
	grepping of make output.  Prefer `cat' over `echo' to append
	to configure.in.  Quote literal dots in grep regexps.  Prefer
	`grep -c ...' over `grep ... | wc -l'.  Make grepping of
	automake stderr slightly stricter.  Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/dejagnu3.test: Prefer `cat' over `echo' to append to
	configure.in.  Check stderr of expected-to-fail "make" call.
	Remove extra blank lines from Makefile.am.
	* tests/dejagnu4.test: Prefer `cat' over `echo' to append to
	configure.in.  Prefer `mv -f' over plain `mv' when the target
	file already exists.  Avoid extra mkdir calls by creating more
	directories at once.  Better use of blank lines.  Check that
	the `*.log' and `*.sum' files are created by runtest also when
	"make check" fails.
	* tests/dejagnu7.test: Prefer `cat' over `echo' to append to
	configure.in.  Better use of blank lines.  Add a trailing `:'
	command.
	* tests/dejagnu6.test: Likewise, and give the dejagnu test a
	more descriptive name.
	* tests/dejagnu5.test: Likewise.  Also, simply define package
	name to `$me' rather than using a non-obvious sed script to
	extract it from `AC_INIT', and write the Makefile.am with only
	one command.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

	tests: avoid spurious failure in 'parallel-tests3.test'
	This fixes automake bug#8788.
	* tests/parallel-tests3.test: To ensure that the serial run of
	the dummy testsuite is still ongoing when the parallel run has
	terminated, use `kill -0', not a bare `kill'.  This will prevent
	a testsuite crash on NetBSD 5.1, and a testsuite hang on FreeBSD
	8.2.  Also, since we are at it, try harder to avoid possible
	hangs of the script in other unusual situations.

2011-10-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: avoid spurious failure of 'uninstall-fail.test' on Solaris
	* tests/uninstall-fail.test: All the Solaris 10 shells (/bin/sh,
	/bin/ksh, and /usr/xpg4/bin/sh), upon failing to chdir to a
	directory with the `cd' builtin, print a message like:
	  "sh: /root: permission denied"
	which doesn't report the `cd' builtin anywhere.  Relax the grepping
	of the error message accordingly.

2011-10-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure with autoconf 2.62
	* tests/aclocal-path-precedence.test: Rewrite configure.in,
	rather than appending to it, to avoid spurious failures (at
	least with autoconf 2.62) due to repeated calls to AC_INIT.
	Also, add package name and version arguments to AC_INIT, to
	avoid spurious errors from automake.

	parallel-tests: warn on conditional TEST_EXTENSIONS definition
	Before this change, automake would have still bailed out, but
	with a confusing error message (about an invalid redefinition
	of TEST_EXTENSIONS).
	* automake.in (handle_tests): Warn explicitly if TEST_EXTENSIONS
	has conditional contents.
	* tests/test-extensions-con.test: New test.

2011-10-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: don't allow @substitutions@ in TEST_EXTENSIONS
	Even after the last commit `v1.11-476-g90bea64', the checks
	performed by automake on entries in $(TEST_EXTENSIONS) tried to
	allow for @substitited@ stuff.  This however ends up allowing
	quite brittle setups, which, most importantly, are of no real
	practical usefulness anyway.  So it's better to just disallow
	@substitutions@ in TEST_EXTENSIONS altogether, offering a clear
	error message, instead of risking weird bugs and unexpected
	behaviors in the generated Makefile.in.
	* automake.in ($TEST_EXTENSION_PATTERN): Turned from a regular
	expression ...
	(is_valid_test_extension): ... into this subroutine.  Don't allow
	generic @substitutions@ anymore (possibly making an exception for
	`@EXEEXT@' under the proper circumstances).
	* tests/test-extensions.test: Adjust and extend.

2011-10-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure in 'insthook.test'
	* tests/insthook.test (Makefile.am): Add a proper `uninstall-hook'
	target to remove the symlink created by the `install-exec-hook'
	target; this prevents "make distcheck" from failing spuriously.
	Since we are at it, delete an extra blank line, and add a trailing

	parallel-tests: no more spurious successes for FreeBSD make
	Work around a bug of FreeBSD make bug that was causing the
	automake-generated "check" target to complete with success
	even if some tests failed; this happened only when FreeBSD
	make was run in concurrent mode (as in, e.g., "make -j2
	check").  The bug is not present in NetBSD make.
	This change fixes automake bug#9245:
	 <http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=9245>

	test defs: new function 'fatal_', for hard errors
	Before this patch, the only way offered by tests/defs to
	properly signal a hard error was the `framework_failure_'
	function.  But the error message issued by that function,
	as its name would suggest, refers to a set-up failure in the
	testsuite, while hard errors can obviously also be due to
	other reasons.  The best way to fix this inconsistency is to
	introduce a new function with a more general error message.
	Inspired by a recent similar change to Gnulib's tests/init.sh.
	* tests/defs.in (fatal_): New function.
	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"):
	Suggest the use of `fatal_', not of `framework_failure_', for
	generic hard errors.  The latter should be reserved for "real"
	set-up failures.

	maintcheck: fix some failures, extend some checks
	* Makefile.am (sc_diff_automake_in_automake): Update, as we

	to `automake'.
	(sc_diff_aclocal_in_aclocal): New maintainer check, similar to

	(syntax_check_rules): Update.
	(sc_tests_Exit_not_exit): Exempt self tests `self-check-*.test'
	from this check, as they can legitimately use the bare `exit'
	builtin in various places.
	* doc/automake.texi (Python): Remove stray `@' from the end of
	a line.  Typo introduced in commit `v1.11-312-g5bf7af6'.
	* tests/depcomp8a.test: Pass DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS to make
	from the environment rather than from the command line, to
	pacify the `sc_tests_overriding_macros_on_cmdline' maintainer

	remake: behave better with non-GNU make in subdirectories
	Currently, with every decent make program, it is possible to
	rebuild out-of-date autotools-generated files with a simple
	"make Makefile" -- but for this to work reliably with non-GNU
	make implementations, the command must be issued from the
	top-level directory.  This patch removes such limitation.
	* lib/am/configure.am (am--refresh): Depend on `%MAKEFILE%'.
	* tests/defs.in (using_gmake): New function, backported from the

	automake, aclocal: honour configure-time AUTOCONF and AUTOM4TE
	Currently, the Automake's own configure script allow definition
	of AUTOCONF and AUTOM4TE, expected to point respectively to an
	autoconf and autom4te programs.  But while these definitions are
	honoured in the Automake's build systems and test suite, they
	were *not* honoured in the generated `automake' and `aclocal'
	scripts.  This behaviour, apart from being wrong in that it does
	not allow the user enough freedom in choosing his tools, also
	caused inconsistencies in the test suite, brining to spurious
	failures.
	Problem reported by Graham Reitz on the automake list; see thread:
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2011-05/msg00022.html>
	* automake.in ($traces): Use `@am_AUTOCONF', not simply `autoconf'.
	* aclocal.in ($traces): Use `@am_AUTOM4TE', not simply `autom4te'.
	* Makefile.am (do_subst): Substitute also `@am_AUTOCONF' and
	`@am_AUTOM4TE'.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* THANKS: Update.

2011-05-29  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	build: the user can override AUTOM4TE, AUTORECONF and AUTOUPDATE too
	Our build system allows the user to override AUTOCONF and AUTOHEADER
	at configure time, and honours these overrides in our testsuite.
	But it didn't do the same with AUTOM4TE, AUTORECONF and AUTOUPDATE.
	This change fixes that inconsistency.
	* configure.ac (am_AUTOM4TE, am_AUTOUPDATE, am_AUTORECONF): New
	AC_SUBSTitutions.  Update comments.
	* tests/defs.in ($AUTOUPDATE): Default to `@am_AUTOUPDATE@' now.
	($AUTOM4TE): New variable, defaulting to `@am_AUTOM4TE@'.
	($AUTORECONF): New variable, defaulting to `@am_AUTORECONF@'.
	* doc/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/amhello-1.0.tar.gz): Update.

	    Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests/README: fix example about `make -e' usage
	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"): When
	some variable is never initialized in the Makefile, `-e' is not
	necessary in order to override it.  DESTDIR is such a variable: we
	ensure that we do not ever initialize it.  And as such, it is quite
	portable to use:
	  $ make DESTDIR=/foo/bar install
	and in fact, quite widely used.
	So our example about when `make -e' is required, which references
	the `DESTDIR' variable, is poorly chosen, if not downright wrong.
	Rewrite it to use `prefix' as the overridden variable instead.

2011-05-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	parallel-tests: stricter checks on DISABLE_HARD_ERRORS support
	* tests/parallel-tests-harderror.test: New test, doing more

	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Remove tests on DISABLE_HARD_ERRORS,
	now redundant.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2011-05-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: avoid re-running few tests with 'parallel-tests' option
	Some tests in our testsuite use the 'simple-tests' driver only
	marginally, or simply as a mean to conveniently check unrelated
	invariants.  It makes little sense to force these tests to also
	run with the 'parallel-tests' Automake option active, as doing so
	offers no real gain in coverage, while often causing a measurable
	overhead in execution time (for an already too-slow testsuite).
	* tests/pr401.test (parallel_tests): Define to "no", to prevent
	the generation of a sibling test script using the 'parallel-tests'
	driver.
	* tests/pr401b.test: Likewise.
	* tests/pr401c.test: Likewise.

2011-05-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	testsuite: allow tests to avoid the use of 'parallel-tests' option
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Do not generate "siblings" for tests
	that explicitly define the `parallel_tests', whether to "yes" or
	to any other value.  Extend heading comments to give a rationale
	for this behaviour.
	* tests/README: Update.

2011-05-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests/README: update obsoleted advice
	* tests/README (Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"):
	Do not suggest to use the `*-p.test' pattern for the names of
	hand-written tests which use the `parallel-tests' Automake option.
	Not only is this not respected by the existing tests, but it is
	more likely to cause conflicts with auto-generated tests.
	So, suggest to *avoid* using the `*-p.test' pattern in names
	of hand-written tests instead.
	(Section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do not"):  When
	suggesting not to override Makefile variables using command
	line arguments, do not use the badly outdated variables `U'
	and 'ANSI2KNR' in the example; instead, use the more common
	and typical `DESTDIR'.

2011-05-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: fix spurious failure of txinfo21.test on FreeBSD
	* tests/txinfo21.test: Use the `is_newest' subroutine instead of
	the `ls -t' hack to to determine whether a file has been updated.
	This is required because at least FreeBSD `ls' do not sort files
	with the same timestamp in alphabetical order when using the `-t'
	option.

2011-05-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests defs: allow requirements for compilers (mostly dummy)
	Most of the new requirements that are now accepted in `$required'
	as consequence of this patch are still dummy.  They are planned
	to be implemented only in master (or in some derived branch), but
	having them here (even just as no-op) will allow for an easier
	integration/backporting of potential new testcases.
	* tests/defs.in (cc, c++, fortran, fortran77): New requirements,
	still dummy.
	(flex): New requirement, picking LEX for configure.
	(lex): New requirement, alias for `flex'.  A more appropriate
	implementation, looking for a generic `lex' program, will follow
	in the future.
	(yacc): New requirement, alias for `bison'.  A more appropriate

	maintcheck: look for problematic names of testcases
	The configure.in stub created by default by `tests/defs' obtains
	the first argument of AC_INIT from the test name, and this can
	cause some supported autoconf versions to fail with a spurious
	error if that test name contains the name of an m4 or m4sugar
	builtin or macro (e.g., `defn' or `m4_undefine').
	See for example the bug fixed by commit v1.11-287-g1325a8a.
	This change add a maintainer check that warns about test names
	which are possibly problematic in this regard.
	* Makefile.am (sc_test_names): New maintainer-check target.
	(syntax_check_rules): Add it.
	(m4_builtins): New helper variable.

	libtool: suggest LT_INIT if LTLIBRARIES primary is used
	When the LTLIBRARIES primary was used, but $(LIBTOOL) wasn't
	defined, automake suggested to add a call to AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
	in configure.ac.  But that macro is deprecated since Libtool
	version 1.9b (2004-08-29), in favor of the newer LT_INIT.  So
	suggest the use of this latter macro instead.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (%_am_macro_for_var): Pair 'LIBTOOL'
	with 'LT_INIT', not with 'AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'.
	* tests/libtool4.test: Adjust and extend.  Also, add a call to
	macro AC_PROG_CC in configure.in, to help ensuring that automake

2011-01-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve, extend and tweak tests on Texinfo support.
	* tests/instdir-texi.test: Add a call to `ls -l' after that to
	`make', for debugging.  When looking for required tools, do not
	redirect the output of "$tool --help" to /dev/null, and do not
	uselessly run it in a subshell.
	* tests/txinfo.test: Rewritten to run autoconf, ./configure and

	* tests/txinfo8.test: Likewise, and modernize the generated
	configure.in.
	* tests/txinfo2.test: Moved checks into Makefile.am, and other

	to be generated only once really are.  Make grepping less strict,
	to avoid exposing too much internal details.  More minor changes.
	* tests/txinfo16.test: Add trailing `:'.  Prefer cat over echo
	for appending to configure.in.  Updated/fixed heading comments.
	* tests/txinfo23.test: Likewise, and extended a little by making
	it check that no info file is created in the $(srcdir).
	* tests/txinfo24.test: Likewise.

	cleaned also by "make clean", not only by "make distclean".
	* tests/txinfo22.test: Prefer `$me' over hard-coded test name,
	and added trailing `:' command.  This testcase also used to check
	that automake ignores in-line comments when using variables, but
	preserves them in the output; these checks (added in commit
	"Release-1-7f-4-g9177ef8") do not really pertain to this test,
	so they have been moved ...

	Fix spurious failures in `silent*.test' for $CC != gcc
	In some tests on automake-produced silent rules, we forced the
	use of gcc depmode to improve testsuite coverage; but this has
	unsurprisingly led to spurious failures when some non-GNU C

	tests that force gcc depmode.

	supposed to perform.

	help2.test: add checks on aclocal too.
	* tests/help2.test: Check that also `aclocal --version' and

	Fix regression in colon{5,6}.test (failures on AIX 5.3).
	* tests/colon5.test: Also substitute `@SHELL@' with `$SHELL' when
	post-processing the generated Makefile.in, to work around a bug
	of AIX 5.3 make which doesn't allow setting the `$(SHELL)' macro
	on the commend line.  Calls to `$MAKE' adjusted accordingly.
	* tests/colon6.test: Likewise.
	Regression introduced in commit v1.11-175-gf9fe878 "Modernize,
	improve and/or extend tests `colon*.test", and reported by Ralf

2010-11-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix regression in ansi.test (failure on AIX 5.3).
	* tests/ansi.test: Remove redundant hackish check done using a
	hand-postprocessed Makefile.in.  This check worked by setting
	the `$(SHELL)' macro on the command line of make, but this is
	not supported by the AIX 5.3 make implementation.
	This bug has been lurking for a long time, and was activated by
	commit v1.11-125-gc1f6cdb "Enable `errexit' shell flag in various
	tests".  Report by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	tests: work around dash quoting issue in case statements.
	* tests/color.test, tests/color2.test: Quote variable in case
	pattern, to avoid skipping tests with dash 0.5.5.1.

2010-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Rebuild menus in the manual.

	Thanks to Ian Lance Taylor for the suggestion.

	Fix install-strip when $(STRIP) contains several words.
	* lib/am/install.am (install-strip): Update comment.  Use

2010-11-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix a bug in variable concatenation with `+='.
	* lib/Automake/VarDef.pm (append): Since the content of the
	"appended-to" variable is going to be unconditionally normalized
	later, simply separate the appended value with a single whitespace
	character, instead of trying to be uselessly smarter by using
	escaped newlines.  This fixes a bug in which extra backslashes
	where erroneously inserted in the variable's final value.
	* tests/pluseq11.test: New test, exposing the bug.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.
	Reported by Andy Wingo.

2010-10-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Improve tests `help*.test' (also fixes maintcheck failures).
	* tests/help.test: To run automake, use `$AUTOMAKE' with all `-W'

	get matched as a rule.
	Suggestion by Ben Pfaff.

2010-10-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Revert "parallel-tests: avoid command-line length limit issue."
	This reverts commit 24e3b4ee2f8cb9f72dd94a05a893f3d4e88b7835,
	because it re-opened the bug fixed by v1.11-10-g218e678.

2010-09-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Extend tests on `--help' and `--version' options.
	* tests/help.test: Create a new empty directory and chdir into
	it, rather than removing already present files.  Run the aclocal
	and automake wrapper scripts directly, instead of relying on
	$AUTOMAKE and $ACLOCAL.  Be sure to correctly match literal dots
	in aclocal's and automake's stderr.  Add a trailing `:' command.
	* tests/help2.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' works in directories with broken `configure.in'.
	* tests/help3.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and

2010-09-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Manual: be more agnostic w.r.t. version control system used.
	* doc/automake.texi (Basics of Distribution): Also refer to `.svn'
	directories as a type of probably-unwanted files that are copied
	regardless when adding directories to EXTRA_DIST.
	(The dist Hook): Show a dist-hook example which removes Subversion
	`.svn' private directories from distdir, rather than CVS private
	directories.

	lib/Automake/.cvsignore, lib/Automake/tests/.cvsignore,
	m4/.cvsignore, tests/.cvsignore: Files deleted.  Even when using
	savannah's CVS readonly mirror there's no way to commit back to
	the real repository, so this files are not worth maintaining or
	keeping around.

2010-09-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	* m4/dmalloc.m4: Bump serial number and copyright years.

2010-09-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	that made the test useless.  Since we are at it, improve
	comments and make grepping of generated Makefile.in slightly
	stricter.
	Regression introduced by change "Modernize, improve and/or
	extend tests `colon*.test" (Stefano Lattarini, 2010-08-08).

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Do not require "gzip" explicitly in tests.
	The gzip utility is simply expected to be present on any decent
	target system for Automake.  So it's pointless to put it in
	$required.
	* tests/install2.test ($required): Do not require "gzip".
	* tests/lex3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/pr9.test: Likewise.
	From a suggestion by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make some `confh*.test' tests more "semantic" (plus tweakings).
	* tests/confh.test: Run "autoconf", "configure" and "make check",
	instead of munging/grepping the generated `Makefile.in'.

	in makefile rules, when it's used to expand a make macro.
	* tests/depcomp5.test: Likewise.

2010-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Docs: clarify how to avoid automatic dependencies tracking.

	* tests/aclocal18.test: Add trailing `:' command, and make
	some grepping slightly stricter.
	* tests/acloca14.test: Likewise.  Also, prefer `diff' over

	Also, add trailing `:' command, and cosmetic changes in spacing.
	* tests/pr224.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier

	changes.  Cosmetic changes to spacing, add trailing `:' command,
	and add a "FIXME" comment.
	* tests/pr266.test: Likewise, and add explicit command line switch
	`--enable-dependecy-tracking' to the ./configure call.
	* tests/pr279.test: Avoid obsolescent constructs in the generated
	`configure.in'; also, use the `configure.in' stub created by
	./defs, rather than writing it from scratch.  Enable `errexit'
	shell flag, and related changes.  Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/pr279-2.test: Likewise, and make grepping of Makefile.in
	stricter.
	* tests/pr307.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier
	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Escape literal
	dots in grep regular expressions.  Also, add a trailing `:'
	command, and cosmetic changes to spacing.

	-static option so that the user can select whether to prefer
	dll import libraries or static libraries.  This enables MSVC to

	.c, .cpp, .CPP, .lib, .LIB and .Lib files.
	* tests/compile3.test: Test the C++ hinting.

	negation.

2010-08-01  Peter Rosin  <peda@lysator.liu.se>

	Wrap some MSVC options in the compile script.
	* lib/compile: MSVC supports naming the output file, the option
	is just not called -o, so transform -o into the appropriate form
	for MSVC. Also wrap some other options while at it (-L, -l, -Wl,
	-Xlinker and -I) and convert file names to windows form where
	needed for those options to make MSVC more usable in an
	autotooled environment.
	* doc/automake.texi (Auxiliary Programs): Document the above
	extension of the compile script.

	`subdir5.test' here).
	* tests/subdir6.test: Cosmetic change in spacing.

	autoconf/automake macros.

	Modernize and improve test scripts `dist*.test'.

2010-07-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve and extend test cond5.test.
	* tests/cond5.test: Do not blindly sleep 60 seconds before polling
	the background automake process, but poll it every 10 seconds for
	at most 30 times (this makes the test both faster on good machines,
	and more resilient to spurious timeout-due failures when in low
	priority or on heavily-loaded systems).
	Check also that automake writes the expected error messages on the
	standard error.
	Enable `errexit' flag, and related changes.
	Rely on the `configure.in' stub created by `./defs', rather than
	writing one from scratch.

	defined).

	Tests: remove useless repetitions of `foreign' automake option.
	* tests/multlib.test (configure.in): Remove useless use of
	`foreign' option in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE (the `--foreign' option is

	instead of egrep) that could have led to false negatives.

2010-06-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Add a test checking that distributed broken symlinks cause

	"Yacc" and "Yacc (C++)", so that $(LFLAGS) has precedence over
	$(AM_LFLAGS) and $(YFLAGS) has precedence over $(AM_YFLAGS).
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Updated accordingly.

	precedence over automake (AM_LFLAGS) and (foo_LFLAGS).  Still
	xfailing.

	* tests/suffix5.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag, and related
	changes.  Make grepping of Makefile.in slightly stricter.
	* tests/suffix.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag, and related
	changes.  Also, do not redirect grep output to /dev/null, as this
	might unmotivatedly hide useful information.
	* tests/suffix2.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier
	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Use a more
	idiomatic way to count text occurrences in Makefile.in with
	grep.  Do not create useless dummy source files.
	* tests/suffix10.test: Ensure verbose printing of captured make
	stdout.  Minor cosmetic changes.

	in ./defs).  Avoid potential problems with unpredictable make
	output.  Finally, make grepping of Makefile.in stricter.
	* tests/substre2.test: Ensure verbose printing of the captured

	which are exported by BSD make when run in parallel mode, and
	which can confuse make processes spawned by our testsuite.
	This change fixes a lot of spurious failure when the testsuite
	is run with BSD make in parallel mode.

	Improved test silent5.test.
	* tests/silent5.test: Remove by hand all generated C files after
	non-verbose builds, to ensure the following builds are clean.
	Try to clean and rebuild with the same verbosity and without
	removing generated sources in between, to check that this does
	not trigger a different set of rules.  Make grepping of make's
	output stricter.  Improved/added some comments.

	New tests for Automake silent-mode with Fortran.
	* tests/silentf77.test: New test.
	* tests/silentf90.test: Likewise.

	Report from Eric Blake and Steve Goetze via gnulib.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix Autoconf version required by Automake's configure.
	Automake configure script used to tell that automake required
	autoconf 2.60 or later, but then it checked for autoconf >= 2.62,
	and if that was not found, it gave an error saying that Automake
	required configure 2.61a-341 or later.  This change should
	eliminate such inconsistencies.
	* configure.ac ($required_autoconf_version): New variable.
	Use it throughout.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* tests/extra10.test, tests/extra11.test, tests/extra12.test:
	Require GNU make.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Avoid possible false negatives in dejagnu7.test.
	* tests/dejagnu7.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Also, avoid
	unportable use of fgrep option `-e'.

	Fix conflnk3.test to work with Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/conflnk3.test: Use `test -r FILE' and `test ! -r FILE'
	instead of respectively `test -e FILE' and `test ! -e FILE',
	since Solaris Sh doesn't grok the latter.  Do not SKIP the test
	if the shell doesn't support `test -e'.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix typo in manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Simple Tests using parallel-tests): Add
	missing closing parenthesis.

	Fix leftover call to removed function macros_dump.
	* automake.in (read_main_am_file): Call variables_dump, not
	macros_dump.  Print actual error before list of variables.

2010-04-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Minor improvements in comments of test `silent3.test'.
	* tests/silent3.test: Tell to keep it in sync with `silent9.test'
	too.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: ensure verbose printing of captured output.
	* tests/acloca14.test, tests/acloca18.test, tests/aclocal.test,
	tests/fort2.test, tests/help.test, tests/missing3.test,
	tests/missing6.test: Print captured stdout or stderr before
	grepping it.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test badopt.test stricter (by enabling `set -e').
	* tests/badopt.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Due to this change,
	an unexpected failure in the call to `$ACLOCAL' (whose outcome
	was previously unchecked) would cause the whole test to fail.
	Also, bumped the copyright years.

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Use `set -e' in confsub.test (avoids possible false negatives).
	* tests/confsub.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and related
	changes (this helps avoiding some possible minor false negatives).
	Also, bumped copyright years.

2010-04-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix -Werror handling for presence of configure.in and configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (Automake::Variable): Do not initialize
	$configure_ac at the global level, before command-line arguments
	have been parsed.
	(require_variables): Initialize it here.
	* tests/configure.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Stefano Lattarini.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and bumped
	copyright years.  Due to this change, any unexpected failure
	in calls to $ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOCONF or $AUTOHEADER, or
	a failure in grepping expected text in output files should now
	cause the whole test to fail.

2010-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in POD documentation of Automake::Channels.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fixed typo in POD documentation:
	@<...> was used instead of C<...>.

2010-04-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	test description.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix per-Makefile.am setting of -Werror.
	Before this patch, 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Werror' in one
	Makefile.am would carry over to other Makefile.am files
	treated afterwards by the same thread, causing inconsistent
	and unstable exit status values.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (dup_channel_setup)
	(drop_channel_setup): Save and restore the setting of
	$warnings_are_errors.
	* tests/werror3.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in confh5.test w.r.t. Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/confh5.test: In the generated Makefile.am: do not use
	`test ! -e FILE' to check for the non-existence of a file, since
	that is not supported by Solaris/Heirloom Sh.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):

	lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm, lib/Automake/Options.pm,
	lib/Automake/Variable.pm, lib/Automake/XFile.pm,
	m4/options.m4, m4/substnot.m4: Fix macro comment format.

	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell

	already unset in the `defs' file.
	* tests/check5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check8.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check9.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check10.test: Likewise.

	wildcards in EXTRA_DIST.
	* tests/extra12.test: New test, check usage of wildcards in

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Necessity of these new tests suggested by Braden McDaniel

2010-01-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix silent-rules output for disabled dependency tracking.
	* lib/am/depend2.am [!%FASTDEP%]: Rework silent-rules variable
	expansion code to also work in the case where %AMDEP% expands
	to FALSE at config.status time, using new substitution string
	%VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* automake.in (verbose_nodep_flag): New function, appending
	`@am__nodep@' to the verbose-variable name.
	(handle_languages): If dependencies are not disabled, use it to
