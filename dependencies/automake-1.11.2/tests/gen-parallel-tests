# For each test in the TESTS list in this Makefile.am file, that itself
# tests features of the TESTS automake interface, generate a sibling
# test that does likewise, but with the option `parallel-tests' enabled.
# Individual tests can prevent the creation of such a sibling by
# explicitly setting the `$parallel_tests' variable to either "yes" or
# "no".  The rationale for this is that if the variable is set to "yes",
# the test already uses the `parallel-tests' option, so that a sibling
# would be just a duplicate; while if the variable is set to "no", the
# test doesn't support, or is not meant to run with, the `parallel-tests'
# option, and forcing it to do so in the sibling would likely cause a
# spurious failure.
